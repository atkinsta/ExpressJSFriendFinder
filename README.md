Homework 11, An ExpressJS app that links users based on survey results

##Technology used

This app uses ExpressJS to create a functioning server, API, and routing system for the app to work. 

Upon filling out the survey and clicking submit, this app makes an API request to its own API, compares your answers to answers of people stored in the API, and returns a best match based on the absolute difference between your answers and the potential matches.
